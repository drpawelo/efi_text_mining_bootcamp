Acknowledgments

This course was built on and expands material developed for a Carpentries course (CC-BY 4.0) with the support of the Centre for Data, Culture and Society.  It was adapted for hybrid online teaching. We thank the Edinburgh Futures Institute for managing the registration for this course.  We would also like to thank Prof. Laura Cram for supporting us in the long-term development of the EFI course as part of EFI's PGT training.
